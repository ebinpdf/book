									<h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>Law of
											Action or Karma</strong></h4>
									<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The universe is governed by Natural
										Laws which are the natural tendencies or principles of life or creation. Some of
										the fundamental natural tendencies are Vibration, Attraction, Repulsion,
										Polarity, Action, and Evolution. These principles apply to both physical and
										metaphysical worlds and operate at every level of creation, from a photon to
										galaxies.
										<br>
										<br>The Law of ‘Action’ or ‘Cause and Effect’ or ‘Karma’ is the natural tendency
										of creation which restores or regains the balance or rhythm or harmony of the
										creation whenever it is distorted. ‘Karma’ is a Sanskrit word that means
										‘Action’ but generally used in place of ‘fate’ or ‘destiny’ or ‘give and take
										account’. As per this principle, for every action, be it benign or malignant,
										creative or destructive, there is an equal return or reaction. This principle
										ensures that ‘as you do is done unto you’ or ‘as you sow so shall you reap’.
										Through the mechanism of the Law of Karma, the soul is purified and evolves
										continuously, until it finally merges with the Universal Creator.
										<br>
										<br>As with every natural law, this is an impersonal law that works everywhere
										and all the time. All great masters were aware of this law and hence they taught
										to ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you’. Newton’s third law of
										motion states that ‘for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction’
										which explains the operation of this principle as far as the physical world is
										concerned. The Law of Action maintains the justice and order of the universe by
										giving a commensurate return for every action.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

									<h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>The
											Mechanism of this Law</strong></h4>
									<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">At the fundamental level, everything
										is soul/photon which is a web of energy complexes. The mechanism of the Law of
										Action is that, every action whether a thought, word, or deed causes a certain
										change in the quantum and nature of the energy complexes of the soul. These
										changes also get recorded or stored as a memory in the soul, which ensures that
										at some point in time, a similar quantum and vibration of energy flows back to
										the user via another soul or circumstance.
										<br>
										<br>This mechanism ensures that in every action the soul earns and later
										receives an equal return of peace and happiness or pain and suffering. Every
										positive thought or deed generates a ‘merit’ or a ‘blessing’ while every
										negative thought or deed generates a ‘demerit’ or a ‘curse’. Whenever one does a
										good deed, it is bound to give a positive return and whenever one does an evil
										deed, it is bound to give a negative return. Each time we forgive and love those
										who create trouble for us or inflict pain on us, we are using the energy
										positively that ensures a similar positive return to us. Similarly, each time we
										hate, inflict pain on others or seek retribution on those who persecute us, each
										time we punish and refuse to forgive, we are using the energy negatively that
										gives a similar negative return to us.
										<br>
										<br>All our actions do have a return that is equivalent to the ‘quantum &amp;
										vibration’ of energy we utilized in the action. The return and equivalence are
										based on the principle that holds us responsible for the energy we use in our
										actions. Because of the operation of this principle, all the choices we make and
										actions we do return to us like the swing of a pendulum. The Law of Action
										assigns results according to the quantum and vibration of energy we use. It is
										simply an immutable law that gives appropriate results to every action
										irrespective of who did what. In other words, under the Law of Action, there is
										a return for every ‘action’ deeded by us each moment.
										<br>
										<br>As long as there is a debit or credit account, a balancing act needs to
										happen in due course because of the operation of this Law. Throughout our lives,
										we are either settling old accounts or creating new ones. When a settlement
										happens, the particular recording/ memory within the doer, that has attracted
										this energy, gets erased or released or balanced and one may say, the ‘karma is
										dissolved or balanced’. If the account cannot be settled in one incarnation, it
										is carried forward to the next incarnation. Though in most cases we may not be
										consciously aware of the give-and-take accounts that happened in a previous
										life, by analyzing the experiences we are going through and the lessons we are
										learning, we can figure out the type of karma we had created.
										<br>
										<br>The Law of Action also ensures that all our subsequent actions correspond to
										what we have already earned or become. Therefore, a negative person attracts
										more negative thoughts from other sources which intensify his feelings/emotions
										leading to mistakes or errors in judgment. This happens because, under the
										influence of strong negative feelings/emotions, the dark deed is perceived by
										the individual as being good and he tends to justify his actions. The soul
										subconsciously allows it to happen so as to suffer the consequences which will
										provide opportunities for learning a certain lesson and experiencing resultant
										transformation. The recording of the changes in the quantum and vibration of
										energy within our soul is the compelling force that guides our thoughts and
										actions.
										<br>
										<br>Because of the operation of the Law of Action, a person or society, by
										creating misery for others, invites misery into their own life. Similarly, any
										country that inflicts pain and suffering upon another country cannot escape the
										just consequence of its actions, when the time is ripe, when its cup of iniquity
										has become full. When darkness prevails over the majority of people on the
										planet or in a country or community, there will be mass sufferings, either
										through war or natural calamities or pandemic diseases. When an individual
										contract a disease or gets into painful situations, it is because of individual
										karma. Whereas a pandemic disease like Covid-19 or world war is consequent to
										the karma on a planetary level. Negative thinking and aggressive and abusive
										behavior towards each other and nature create disturbances in the energy
										vibrations of individuals and the planet and leads to events like diseases,
										wars, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, floods, climate change,
										etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

									<h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>How to
											consciously align our life with this Law</strong></h4>
									<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We create our lives and we can only
										create those things that are in alignment with our inner state. Today’s
										circumstances are the result of yesterday’s choices and actions and tomorrow’s
										circumstances will be the result of today’s choices and actions. Further,
										today’s choice determines what type of choices will be available to us tomorrow.
										It may be true that we may not be able to pinpoint the ‘ultimate’ cause of most
										of the events in our life as every event is an effect of a previous cause, and
										that previous cause is also an effect of a cause still more remote. At the back
										of every action, we find some actions that lead us to the one that we may be
										considering now, but we cannot easily recognize what triggered those initial
										actions. However, a conscious person can see a pattern emerging from these
										events which correspond to certain behaviors or beliefs or thoughts.
										<br>
										<br>Our environment (sorroundings and circumstances), especially people, acts as
										a mirror where we can see our reflection/image. They show us the mirror and help
										us to transform as we recognize many of our imbalances when we see them in
										others with whom we have close/regular interactions. This is all the more so
										with family members and other close relationships, who put the magnifying glass
										over our shortfalls or imbalances and allow us to balance them. Like everything
										else, we attract such people and circumstances to help us correct our
										imbalances. Our incarnation and life are preplanned and re-planned in such a way
										that we come across those people and circumstances with whom there are karmic
										accounts to be settled. This is the way our soul plans its evolution in each
										incarnation. These catalysts will continue in our life until we fully
										evolve/transform.
										<br>
										<br>We can see a repeating pattern of these reflections or projections at
										multiple situations in our life. And it appears that we are forced to endure
										those situations as if we are stuck there. In most cases, whatever is the
										behavior/nature of these individuals/circumstances that bugs us or causes
										negative feelings/emotions in us, is an area which we are still struggling to
										balance or master. When we analyze or meditate on these catalysts then we can
										see that each of them is trying to teach us some virtue like patience,
										self-control, forgiveness, love, etc., which is the opposite of our
										struggles/imbalances.
										<br>
										<br>Our feelings/emotions tell us whether we are in alignment with our true
										nature and purpose of life or not at any point in time. Positive feelings say we
										are in alignment and negative feelings say we are not in alignment. Negative
										feelings tell us to change whereas positive feelings tell us, it is where we
										need to be. These feelings/emotions guide us to be in alignment with our true
										nature and purpose. Further, our feelings/emotions determine our reality because
										we attract what we love, fear, hate, etc. If we are judgmental then we encounter
										judgmental people all around us. If we are nonjudgmental then we encounter
										nonjudgmental people in our day to day interactions. If we hate
										people/circumstances, then we come across lots of hateful people/circumstances
										and when we start loving others, we suddenly find a change in those
										people/circumstances towards us or we see those people/circumstances being
										replaced with loving ones. This means that when we get transformed or balanced,
										then we do not need certain lessons anymore and they just go away, and we avoid
										attracting such imbalanced people or circumstances in our life again.
										<br>
										<br>In other words, our feelings/emotions determine our reality because we
										attract what we love, fear, hate, etc. If we are judgmental then we encounter
										judgmental people all around us. If we are nonjudgmental then we encounter
										nonjudgmental people in our day to day interactions. If we hate
										people/circumstances, then we come across lots of hateful people/circumstances
										and when we start loving others, we suddenly find a change in those
										people/circumstances towards us or we see those people/circumstances being
										replaced with loving ones. Our environment is just acting like a mirror and it
										cannot reflect a mango if an apple is held before it. As our inner state
										changes, our environment responds to it automatically. This means that when we
										get transformed or balanced, then we do not need certain experiences/lessons
										anymore and they just go away, and we avoid attracting such imbalanced people or
										circumstances in our life again. If we express love in all our acts, then over a
										period of time, we are cleansed of all negative feelings/emotional energy and
										are left with only positive vibrations within. And our environment, including
										the physical body, faithfully reflects or projects our inner state –the state of
										our soul.
										<br>
										<br>We need to be watchful and mindful of those triggers or catalysts that cause
										negative feelings/emotions like fear, anger, lust, greed, impatience,
										restlessness, jealousy, hatred, etc. It is therefore important that we
										introspect or review our life regularly, at least once a day, to see where we
										need change or improvements. We should examine our lives to figure out what our
										external environment is trying to teach us by those circumstances and behaviors
										of other-selves and by the feelings they are creating in us. Furthermore, we
										should figure out why we did what we did and what were the mistakes we
										committed, and what would have been the ideal choice of action. Then we need to
										accept the day’s experience as it is and forgive other-selves and our self for
										the mistakes, if any and thank every participant for his attempt to teach us. We
										should also bless all those people whom we perceive have wronged us or have
										caused inconvenience or pain to us and should love them unconditionally. With
										this, we will be able to balance or transform our soul from any blockages or
										imbalances.
										<br>
										<br>To further simplify this process, we can divide it into four
										steps.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. become conscious of the imbalances,
										<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. accept them,
										<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c. forgive ourselves and others for these imbalances,
										and
										<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;d. develop/ manifest the opposite of those
										imbalances/feelings/emotions and express unconditional
										love.<br><br>Self-analysis (introspection), meditation, intuition, and dreams
										are important tools we can use for clearing and balancing the energies of our
										soul and evolve. The key requirement for using <br>these tools is a calm and
										focused mind. A calm state can be achieved by removing distractions in our life
										and focus can be achieved by training/discipline.&nbsp;<br>

									<h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5">
										<strong>Conclusion</strong>
									</h4>
									<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The Law of Action or Karma ensures
										that the aggregate of our past lives (of previous incarnations and the present
										life until now) determines our destiny. We can ignore the Law and suffer its
										consequences or consciously cooperate and enjoy peace and happiness. Until we
										are awake and attain a certain balance, we experience a roller coaster life
										because of the operation of this Law. It is an immutable Law and we cannot wish
										away the consequences of our actions. Nobody can escape this law – we are paid
										in the same coin that we give. This law helps us to be reminded that our
										environment and our situations today are the net result of what we thought and
										did in the past.
										<br>
										<br>Everyone will receive according to what they give in thought, word, or
										action. And the receiving is faster now because our planet has moved into higher
										vibrations of its next phase of existence, that is fourth density. Though many
										do not understand the underlying mechanism of this principle, everyone, by
										experience has learned the relationship between cause and effect and hence
										avoids doing certain things that could give them unpleasant results, just like
										the child who attempted to touch the flame and burnt its fingers tries to keep a
										safe distance from it next time. This law does not put us in a hopeless
										situation, but it teaches us what is good and what is harmful. If we take time
										to reflect on our lives and take corrective actions, try to meditate, and think
										positively regularly, we can easily keep all our rays/chakras in a good
										condition and experience abundant health and happiness.
